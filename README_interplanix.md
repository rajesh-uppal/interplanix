# 🛰️ Interplanix Monorepo

**Interplanix** is a forward-looking systems initiative aimed at advancing autonomous space situational awareness (SSA), lunar exploration, and intelligent satellite threat forecasting. This monorepo brings together all the interconnected projects that support our mission to develop intelligent, modular, and scalable tools for secure and sustainable space operations.

---

## 🌌 Vision

To empower sovereign space capabilities by building open, intelligent, and modular systems for orbital awareness, lunar colonization, and interplanetary resilience.

---

## 🎯 Mission

- To simulate, analyze, and mitigate risks posed by increasing space traffic and orbital debris.
- To develop AI-augmented dashboards and automation tools for military-grade decision-making in space operations.
- To design simulation-based planning tools for the next era of Moon exploration and off-world settlements.
- To support open-source collaboration on emerging space threats and sustainability.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

### ✅ Phase 1 (Complete)
- Develop AI-driven orbital analysis & debris tracking tools.
- Integrate satellite TLE data to simulate global risk maps.
- Simulate and visualize terrain from LOLA DEM data for lunar base planning.

### 🧪 Phase 2 (Ongoing)
- Integrate ML prediction for collision avoidance and maneuver simulation.
- Extend SSA to include missile threat visualization and near-Earth object (NEO) tracking.
- Begin simulation-based planning for robotic and crewed Moon landings.

### 🚀 Phase 3 (Upcoming)
- Real-time integrated dashboard combining SSA, lunar risk maps, and communication relays.
- Modular lunar colonization architecture: site selection, terrain routing, and logistics.
- Multi-orbit data fusion: integrating CubeSats, ground stations, and Starlink-based telemetry.
