# 🛰️ Global Satellite Risk Monitoring Tool (Interplanetary-Ready)

This tool visualizes satellite and mission risk levels in Earth orbit — and now extended to simulate interplanetary paths like Earth→Moon→Mars.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time satellite risk levels based on TLE data
- Color-coded risk zones (Low, Medium, High)
- Interactive map with hover tooltips
- 📡 Now includes Earth–Mars mission arcs and Mars orbiters
- 🌞 Solar weather zones (future)
- ☄️ Asteroid encounter overlays (planned)
